diaspora-rss

This is a little perl daemon that aggregates RSS/Atom feeds and posts them to a Diaspora* user account.
This enables you to use you stream as feedreader if you follow the specific hashtags in Diaspora*.

INSTALL:
First of all, make sure you have all necessary perl dependencies installed, under Debian squeeze, I had to add the following packages (hope I did not miss one):

libfile-pid-perl
libxml-feedpp-perl
libhtml-wikiconverter-perl
liblist-moreutils-perl
libconfig-tiny-perl

src/modules/HTML/WikiConverter/Diaspora.pm:
The Diaspora.pm module is an additional dialect for the WikiConverter which allows conversion from html to a markup dialect. Since the WikiConverter does 
not seem to support the Diaspora* markup dialect yet, I added it (for at least the very bare tags I need so far).
The file needs to be copied to the appropriate location, for Debian squeeze that is '/usr/share/perl5/HTML/WikiConverter/'.

src/diaspora-rss:
This is the daemon script. I put it in '/usr/local/bin' and use a script '/etc/init.d/diaspora-rss' to start/stop the deamon. Under debian you can use the template '/etc/init.d/skeleton' and just adjust the path and name.

etc/diaspora-rss/diaspora-rss.conf:
This is the configuration file, where you configure the feeds to be queried and the Diaspora* account to be posted to. It must be  copied to
'/etc/diaspora-rss/diaspora-rss.conf' on your machine.
There is a section [main] where you have to enter the pod details and a section [feeds] where you can configure the RSS/Atom feeds to be queried.
The bot needs to have write access to this file, as it uses it as feeditem cache as well.
Since it contains the plaintext password of the bot's diaspora account, you should only make it readable for root.

Final words:
I am not a perl programmer, in fact, this is more or less my first 'real' perl program, so don't be too harsh about the code ;)
