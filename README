diaspora-rss

This is a little perl script that aggregates RSS/Atom feeds and posts them to a Diaspora* user account.
This enables you to use you stream as feedreader if you follow the specific hashtags in Diaspora*.
Some more info can be found here: https://pod.fractal.bz/posts/1859

Currently, the script runs as part of a regular cron job, but I will extend it to a proper daemon.
This allows more flexibility, e.g. not every feed needs to be checked every 5 or 10 minutes (think of dilbert.com for example).

INSTALL:
First of all, make sure you have all necessary perl dependencies installed, under Debian squeeze, I had to add the following packages (hope I did not miss one):

libxml-feedpp-perl
libhtml-wikiconverter-perl
liblist-moreutils-perl
libconfig-tiny-perl

src/modules/HTML/WikiConverter/Diaspora.pm:
The Diaspora.pm module is an additional dialect for the WikiConverter which allows conversion from html to a markup dialect. Since the WikiConverter does 
not seem to support the Diaspora* markup dialect yet, I added it (for at least the very bare tags I need so far).
The file needs to be copied to the appropriate location, for Debian squeeze that is '/usr/share/perl5/HTML/WikiConverter/'.

src/diaspora-rss:
This is the main script. Basically you can put it where you want, I use '/usr/local/bin/' for it.
I configured my cronjob to call it every 10 minutes (crontab -e):
*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/diaspora-rss >> /var/log/diaspora-rss.log

etc/diaspora-rss/diaspora-rss.conf:
This is the configuration file, where you configure the feeds to be queried and the Diaspora* account to be posted to. It must be  copied to
'/etc/diaspora-rss/diaspora-rss.conf' on your machine.
There is a section [main] where you have to enter the pod details and a section [feeds] where you can configure the RSS/Atom feeds to be queried.
The bot needs to have write access to this file, as it uses it as feeditem cache as well.
Since it contains the plaintext password of the bot's diaspora account, you should only make it readable for root.

Final words:
I am not a perl programmer, in fact, this is more or less my first 'real' perl program, so don't be too harsh about the code ;)
